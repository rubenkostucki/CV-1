I'm curious about everything.

## Skills
#### Communication  
  - Led communication with key senior stakeholders as a junior technical architect for Entryphone Systems. Responsibilities included explaining and presenting key technical concepts to product owners and liaising with clients and engineers to build user stories.
  - Sales experience working as lead front-of-house for an award winning restaurant required a confident, calm and professional demeanour at all times.
  - Worked as a kitesurfing instructor, coaching both individuals and groups of students.
  
#### Learning & Problem-Solving
  - A passion for improving processes or problem-solving has been the unifying characteristic of every role in which I have worked in and I have always prided myself on an ability and love of picking up new concepts quickly.
  - As an internal audit assistant, I automated much of the work, originally intended to be done manually, that was involved in a company’s backdated financial reporting.
  - I established a vastly improved order-processing system after realising the inefficiency of the current implementation during an internship at a small internet retail company.
